# Experiments analysis framework

This repo contains the code for visualizing A/B experiments. It is build in python using [dash](https://plot.ly/dash), which uses flask as the backend and react in the frontend. It was build while I was working at SimpleSite, and it looks like the image below. In the future I plan to add some more documentation here, on how to run it and adapt for your own A/B experiments data.
